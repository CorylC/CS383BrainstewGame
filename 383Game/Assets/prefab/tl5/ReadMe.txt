Box:

The box prefab is what is being shot out of the cannon towards the player. It currently is generated at the 
tip of the cannon and moves in a straight line towards where the enemy was when the box object copy was generated.

Ground Enemy:
This is the tracking ground enemy that can be dragged and dropped into any scene. The enemy contains scripts called
"walkable" and "ground movement" which allow it to follow the main character and speed up towards the player, overshooting
if the player jumps over the enemy. "enemy stats" and "enemy cause damage" mean that the player can shoot the enemy
with a gun and the enemy damages the player on contact. There's also an animation on it. The walking thanggg.
